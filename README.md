🌐 Project Overview
As part of the AWS SimuLearn assignment, I stepped into the role of a cloud solutions architect, working through a real-world customer scenario. I assessed requirements, designed a cloud-based solution, and implemented it using the AWS Management Console.

This hands-on lab gave me practical experience in deploying and managing cloud resources, and I gained familiarity with tools used by cloud professionals worldwide.
